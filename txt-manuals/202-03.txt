Inform Radio Motor Patrol Operator of any deficiencies found and
record findings in digital Activity Log.

difficult to engage due to space constraints.
NOTE
There is an increased risk of significant injury to members of the service who do not
wear safety belts. There is no question that wearing a safety belt when involved in a
motor vehicle collision reduces the extent and severity of injuries and saves lives.
Therefore, the wearing of safety belts is required for all individuals operating or riding in a
Department vehicle (marked or unmarked) or a private vehicle authorized for Department
use. Safety belts may be removed ONLY when a member of the service is involved in what
appears to be a dangerous tactical situation and the wearing of the safety belt may impair the
member’s ability to take police action.
